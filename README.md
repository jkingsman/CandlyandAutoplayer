# Autoplayer for Candyland

I wanted to try my hand at writing Go, a language I have zero experience in. This is probably a disaster from a code perspective and is obviously dumb in terms of what it does, but it's a playground for me to learn some more about the language.

## Usage

`go run candlyand.go Francine Bucky Michael Robert`

## Example

```
go run candlyand.go Francine Bucky Michael Robert
